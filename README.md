# Splitter

This let's you split an image into low-res triangles. It uses some basic AI tools to break up the image in the most optimal places so that we reproduce the original image as best as possible. It tries to minimize the average color "distance" between the actual color of a pixel and the color of the triangle that covers it. Less difference is better.
